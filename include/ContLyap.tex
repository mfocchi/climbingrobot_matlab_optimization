\section{Reachability and Lyapunov}

Let us consider the system canonical form~\eqref{eq:CanonicalForm},
and let us consider that the inputs $F_{u,n}$, $F_{u,t}$ and $F_{r}$
are all fully available to control the system. By computing the
involutive distribution $\Delta_n$, if it is nonsingular the system is
locally reachable~\cite{isidori1985nonlinear}. As such, consider the
system state definition in~\eqref{eq:State}.
