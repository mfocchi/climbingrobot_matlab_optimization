% Strong background references addresses "what is already known" 
The idea of developing climbing robots was expected for years but only in 1986, 
Nishi et al. presented the design of a robot that can walk on a vertical surface
in their seminal paper \cite{Nishi1986}. During the last thirty years, many 
prototypes of climbing robots were proposed for specific applications to replace 
humans in dangerous and difficult tasks including, inspection in nuclear power 
plants \cite{Briones1994}, high-rise building cleaning \cite{Nansai2016}, bridges 
maintenance \cite{Wang2016}, search and rescue missions \cite{Eich2008}. 
However, % Mention a Gap in knowledge
there are still other intelligent ways to climb walls not yet studied or 
reported \cite{bio_inspired2015}. 

% Introduction of the problem 
The research work done so far on climbing robots is reviewed and classified in 
\cite{Fang2022} and \cite{A.Hajeeretall2020} respectively, according to the 
adhesion method \cite{longo2008}, used to attach the robot to the wall and 
locomotion \cite{Chu2010}, type of the walking mechanism. These are considered 
as the two main problems to be solved in designing wall-climbing robots. Other 
requirements may also be requested depending on the desired application, namely: R1) to 
move safely, and R2) fast in emergency situations, R3) ability to carry a payload, 
and R4) avoiding obstacles \cite{Schmidt2013}.

% Summurizing what's coming in the introduction
In this paper, we will discuss a rescue missions climbing robot that uses a rope/wire 
as an attachment method, and jumping as an moving technique to reach a desired 
locations on a mountain, overcoming obstacles.

%% Solution for Attachment technique : USING A ROPE + main advantages   
Firstly, humans inspired the technique of using a rope mainly for safety measures 
to support the weight of persons during facade cleaning, fire fighting rescue, .. etc 
\cite{Nansai2016}. It is well known that legged robots as well as mobile robots in a slope 
with very high inclinations \cite{Abdalla12020}, creates a tangential force on the terrain 
that surpasses the friction force that is needed to prevent slippage and falling.
 
Instead, the use of a rope for robots introduces an external force to compensate for gravity and 
allow the contact forces to better satisfy the friction constraints (i.e., lay more in 
the middle of the friction cones) which ensures inherent safety (R1) from falling because 
the robot is always attached to wall.

%% second advantage of using a rope : increase speed of movment 
In addition, similar to the recently bio-inspired dragline locomotion from spiders in 
\cite{Wang2014}. the aid of rope can dramatically increase the locomotion speed (R2) 
by a winding and releasing mechanism, therefore being a preferable solution in applications
that require a prompt intervention such as: search and rescue missions.  
  
%% Third advantage 
Furthermore, the amount of payload that can be carried by sticky/adhesive based climbing 
robots \cite{Kim2008,Riskin2009} is very limited due to the small tangential component of 
the adhesive and leg actuation. While, a feature of rope being inextensible (limited by the 
maximum force deliverable by the winding mechanism, e.g. an hoist which can be extended using
a gearbox) will allow the robot to carry a much higher amount of payload (R3). 

%Difficulties due to the dynamics when using a rope
After all, having the robot attached to a rope poses some challenges: one, is the 
under-actuation where the robot cannot control the position of its center of mass when 
it not in contact with the wall and the other, is that a rope represents a unilateral 
constraint (can only pull and not push), which further complicates the already hybrid 
dynamics and the low control authority of this class of robots. 

% Providing a solution for second problem: locomotion technique, we can reach the target with jumps 
Secondly, An example of a rapid jumping locomotion is shown in \cite{Haldane2017}, so 
rather than slowly taking steps as a walking technique, the robot can take one or multiple 
jumps to reach the desired location.

%Difficulties in the jumping technique
The key feature of jumping with rope that can be released, relies both in the locomotion speed and the 
ability to address up to vertical inclinations. However, the resulting motion of the 
robot (and so the possibility to reach the target) will depend on two factors: 1) the initial 
impulse that the robot exerts on the wall at lift-off, 2) the time-law needed for the rope to 
be released/re-winded.

%Optimization for plannig 
Therefore, a planning strategy for these kind of motions, to be successful, it should take 
into account both these two factors besides the under-actuation of the robot and the 
physical constraints, namely: the constrains posed by the rope, the actuator limits and the 
contact interaction (i.e. friction). 

Numerical optimization is an attractive solution for this 
planning problems \cite{Nguyen2019,Ding2020} because it allows to jointly cope with these 
aspects in an optimal fashion while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied in a planning 
horizon resulting in a feasible trajectory. Casting the locomotion planning as an optimization 
problem allows one to represent high level tasks and system dynamics using cost functions and 
constraints. 

In this framework different goals can also be pursued. for instance, minimize energy 
consumption or hoist effort. Also, the jump time can be minimized to achieve the target 
in a shortest time in case of emergencies and rescue missions. 


\subsection{Proposed Approach and Contribution}
In this work, we present a novel robotic platform called CLIO that is able to 
reach desired targets on a vertical wall. We propose planning approaches 
based on numerical optimization to solve the jumping problem employing a simplified 
model of the dynamics.
To summarize, the contributions of the paper are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a novel design of a jumping robot platform CLIO 
	\item a planning approach, based on optimal control, to generate a desired jump 
	motion, overcoming an obstacle comparing pros and cons of each approach.
	\item simulations and experiments to validate  the effectiveness of the proposed approach 
	in a simulation with a simplified model and in a realistic (gazebo) simulation with the 
	full dynamics of the robot.
\end{itemize}
