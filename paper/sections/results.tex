This section presents simulation results that show that the planned impulses and retraction forces, 
result in of the optimization in Section \ref{sec:motionP} bring the robot to a desired target. 
We compare the simulated trajectories for the simplified model (Matlab) and for the full 3D model (Gazebo).
We set several targets for the simulation
