In this paper we presented a  novel robotic solution for exploration and rescue 
missions in mountain environments such as Canyons, lunar craters. Our platform combines the  use of a rope of adjustable length with a jumping mechanism.
Many important future directions have been opened by this research and are
reserved for our future investigation.
The first is to release the point-mass approximation and consider a robot with
non-trivial mass geomtery. In this case, the thrust action has to be combined with a way to contro the rotation of the body and to secure the proper alignment of the lef for the landing. Much work has to be done also in the area of motion control in order to ensure that the planned trajectory is closely tracked during the flight. Last, we are working on the design of a landing controller to dissipate the landing kinetic energy avoiding rebounc. All these steps are propedeutic to the development of a working prototype.
