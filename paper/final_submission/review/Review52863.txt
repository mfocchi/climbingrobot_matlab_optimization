Reviewer 8 of ICRA 2023 submission 1895

Comments to the author
======================

Authors present a concept for a rope aided climbing robot
in simulation environment. 

In the abstract authors should clearly mention that their
work is in simulation environments just to make sure that
readers are not confused. 

I suggest authors to include some results in numbers
towards the end of the abstract to make readers easily cite
their paper. Any surprising results? If so please highlight
them in the abstract. 

“However, there are still ways to climb walls not yet
studied or reported” authors cited a paper but did not
mention those ways, please let the readers know by adding. 

“The research work done so far on climbing robots is
reviewed and classified in [7] and [8], respectively,
according to the adhesion technique [9] used to attach the
robot to the wall surface, and locomotion mechanism [10],
utilized for climbing.” In this sentence authors directly
connect references without explaining them. Authors should
explain those citation not just cite them with numbers.
This make it hard to understand without reading the cited
papers. 

Dividing section 1 to sub section A does not seem
necessary. Please remove subsection and make the flow of
your contribution within section 1 without a subsection. 

When authors say: “A novel design of a jumping robot
platform CLIO” I start to think of a robot hardware. I do
suggest re-wording this contribution. 

I understand why authors want to use word ‘novel’ in their
paper. However, I generally avoid using words such as
“novel’, ‘for the first time’, first time ever’ as the big
journals want authors to not use those words. However,
authors can use the word novel if they wish to. I suggest
not. When your work is novel community praise the work’s
novel approach by citing the paper. 

Authors showcased their assumptions for the simplified
model. That is great.

Can authors add a map or comparison list between other
climbing robots for the cost of climbing? And we can see a
detailed place of their robot in terms of energy efficiency
between climbing robots out in the literature?

Figure 5 label on the right too small. 

A good paper is a paper that gives new research ideas to
reader. I do suggest authors to add areas of work needs to
be researched so that this robot can be built in hardware. 

Authors also recall the limitations of this study in the
conclusion. 

I suggest authors to release their model over GitHub and
cite it for readers to be able to replicate their work. 


Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

good video, but transition animations are disturbing a bit
