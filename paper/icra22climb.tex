\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
% introduction of the problem
Today, Robots are capable of climbing vertical walls replacing humans to do difficult tasks and preventing them from dangerous situations \cite{tag0}.The idea of developing climbing robots was expected for years but only until 1986, A.NISHI et al. were the first who designed a robot that can walk on a vertical wall in their seminal paper \cite{seminal_paper}. After that during the last three decades many prototypes (over 200) were proposed according to the desired purpose of the climbing robot e.g, inspection, cleaning, and maintenance of tall towers,.. etc. However, the designing structure requires solving two problems. one is the type of adhesion method that should be used to attach the robot to the wall. and second, the type of walking mechanism that should be used to climb the wall \cite{TAVAKOLI2015301}.
