\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we presented a  novel robotic solution for exploration and rescue 
missions on rocky environments such as Canyons, lunar craters, etc.
where we combined the usage of a rope of adjustable length with a jumping motion.

dealing with this is out of the scope of this paper (and part of future works). 

% future works 
extend optimization to the full dynamics considering angular dynamics 
multiple jumps 
design of a non linear controller to more efficiently track the planned trajectory
experiments with the real platform 
Design of a landing controller to dissipate the landing kinetic energy without rebounce
