	abstract = {Climbing robots are a special breed of service robots developed in the last three decades and used for many tasks which involve safety risks to humans. While numerous prototypes have been developed, employing many different technologies for both adhesion and locomotion, not always observed in nature, some of them have drawn inspiration from climbing animals. In this chapter, we explore the novel bio-inspired mechanisms used in climbing robots and their current state-of-the-art and limitations, discussing adhesion techniques such as mechanical seizing, form fit, wet and dry adhesion, and also locomotion modes such as brachiating, dragline locomotion, limbless locomotion, dynamic climbing, and multimodal locomotion. Finally, we discuss some promising developments and likely future trends in this field of robotics.}
