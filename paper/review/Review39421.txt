Reviewer 7 of ICRA 2023 submission 1895

Comments to the author
======================

This paper does a good job of presenting a problem and
proposing a novel solution method. The robot design
combined with the optimization based control technique seem
novel and intelligent. The dynamics derivation seems
thorough and correct.

Key feedback:
The main points that I would like to see improved are
mainly in the results section. The cone obstacle that is
presented is a good example to start with, but I think it
is important to include an additional, more complex terrain
to test on as well. This would also make the reachability
analysis more interesting.
I would also implore the addition of a Figure from the
Gazebo simulations, since these should be the most
convincing example of the robots efficacy.
It appears that the simplified model is highly accurate
when applied to the full dynamics. I would like additional
discussion on if this is generally true, or if there
examples where the simple model fails. In general,
additional discussion of the limitations of the work would
strengthen this paper.

Miscellaneous Feedback (less important):
Figure 1 could contain a clearer and more intuitive
rendering of the robot. This would aid in the reader's
appreciation of the work.
In section II, I find footnote 2 to be significant enough
to warrant being included in the main body.
In section IIC, you claim it is not possible to us
linearized dynamics. Can you be more detailed about why
this  is true? Can you present a simple example where the
linearization fails?
Figure 3 does not seem to communicate much information. It
might be better to replace it with a simper figure or table
showing tracking error.

Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

This video was helpful for the videos of the Matlab and
Gazebo simulations of the robot. I would appreciate a
little more discussion on the optimization, or at least a
description of what the optimization problem you're solving
is.
