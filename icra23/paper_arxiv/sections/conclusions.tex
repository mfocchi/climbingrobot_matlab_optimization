We presented a novel robotic solution for exploration and rescue 
missions in mountain environments such as Canyons, lunar craters. Our platform combines the use of a rope of adjustable length with a jumping mechanism.
Many important future directions have been opened by this research.
The first is to release the point-mass approximation and consider a robot with
non-trivial mass geometry. In this case, the thrust action has to be combined with a way to control the rotation of the body and to secure the proper alignment of the leg for landing. 
Much work has to be done also in the area of motion control in order to ensure that the planned trajectory is closely tracked during the flight. Last, we are working on the design of a landing controller to dissipate the landing kinetic energy avoiding rebounces. All these steps are preparatory to the development of a working prototype.
