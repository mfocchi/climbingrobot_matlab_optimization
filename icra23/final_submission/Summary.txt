The video presents a kinematic description of the CLIO robot and of the
optimal control problem used to plan jumping trajectories. Next are shown simulations to validate 
the accuracy of the simplied model against the high detail one. Then, multiple jumping targets are reached in
a Gazebo simulation using the trajectories optimized with the simplified model. Finally, a reachability analysis is 
illustrated to show the limitations of the approach.
