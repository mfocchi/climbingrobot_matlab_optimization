   abstract = {Individuals of most bat species hang head-down by their toenails from rough surfaces, but Madagascar's endemic sucker-footed bat (Myzopoda aurita) clings head-up to smooth leaves using specialized pads on its wrists and ankles. We investigated the adhesive performance of 28 individuals and found that attachment performance on brass was not affected by the presence or absence of a seal around the pad-surface interface. Furthermore, on smooth acrylic, the wrist pads were more than nine-fold weaker when lifted perpendicular to the surface than when pulled parallel to it. The unimportance of a seal and the difference in strength in those directions on a smooth surface are characteristic of wet adhesion, but not of suction. Thus, despite its name, the sucker-footed bat appears to adhere using wet adhesion. We observed that when wrist pads were pushed anteriorly, they unpeeled easily from the surface because of deformation of the pads. This most likely permits rapid detachment during crawling, but would also cause passive detachment if bats roosted head-down. This provides an ecomorphological explanation to the head-up roosting behaviour of these unique bats. The results obtained in the present study thus link morphology, behaviour, and roosting ecology for an enigmatic Malagasy endemic.},
